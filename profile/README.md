# Eurosky

A European social network built on the AT Protocol (Bluesky).

## About

This is the next era of social media—built in Europe, run on our cloud, ruled by our laws. Users choose the content. Businesses control their brand environment. People control the algorithms.

Not Big Tech. Not ever.
